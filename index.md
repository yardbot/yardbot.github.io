# About

Improper disposal of yard waste, such as dry leaves and grass clippings, poses an environmental threat. These contents often end up in landfills, producing harmful methane gas as they decompose.

To properly dispose of yard waste from Chicago households, Yard Bot will test the concept of a crowd-sourced collection fleet by recruiting 50 drivers in Fall 2018.

The Yard Bot Facebook Messenger service will also allow citizens to request a yard waste pickup in 20 seconds, rather than five minutes by phone or website
